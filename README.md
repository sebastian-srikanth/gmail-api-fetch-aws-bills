# 🚀 Unleash the Power of Gmail and AWS Bills! 💰📧

Hey there, tech explorer! 👋 Welcome to the Gmail API Adventure where we'll take you on a journey to unlock the hidden treasures of your AWS bills using some cool code tricks! 🌟

Ever wondered how to make sense of those AWS expenses? Fear not, because we're turning it into a fun quest for you! 🕵️‍♂️

## What's Inside the Box? 🎁

This awesome code collection has three magical Python files that are your key to understanding AWS bills like a pro:

1. **google_apis.py**
    * This one's like a spellbook for Gmail magic! It helps us use the Gmail API, which is like a special key to open your Gmail vault.
2. **extract_text.py**
    * Have you ever wanted to turn a secret PDF scroll into an easy-to-read map? This file is like a magical translator that changes PDFs into friendly CSV files!
3. **main.py**
    * Hold on tight, because this is where the real adventure begins:
    * Imagine creating magical keys (API objects) to unlock Gmail's secrets.
    * Think of your code as a brave knight collecting treasure (PDFs) from your AWS emails.
    * Picture a wizard saving those treasures in a special chest (output directory).
    * And finally, witness the ultimate spell that transforms PDF texts into CSV potions!
## Let's Get Started, Apprentice! 🧙‍♂️✨

Even if you're a newbie, fear not! I'll guide you step by step on this quest:

1. **The First Scroll: Clone the Quest**
    * Imagine you're copying a magical map. In your computer's secret chamber (command line), type:
```
git clone https://github.com/sebastian-srikanth/gmail-api-fetch-aws-bills.git
```
2. **Prepare Your Tools: The Magic Commands**
    * Imagine gathering ingredients for a magic potion. In the command line, enter:
```
cd gmail-api-fetch-aws-bills
```
And then, install python external packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Casting the Enchantment: The Main Spell**
    * It's showtime! With the following spell, you summon code magic:
```
python main.py
